We work in the www folder

To start a server with our work write
npm start www 4000
in your terminal

If you want to view the documentation for the framework
we use when we program write
npm start www 5000
in your terminal

You can the documentation and our project running at the same time - use several terminal windows/tabs i Visual Studio Code. 

IMPORTANT!

We now let the server work against a database called workingDb.db This database is NOT in Git (and should not be!)
To create it make a copy of dhyrRumson.db and rename it workingDb.db.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT CHANGE TO THE DB, make it in dhyrRumson.db and tell the other team members to update!
This stops conflicts every time the server changes the  DB!
